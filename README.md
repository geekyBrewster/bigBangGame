<p>Second day's work on playing around with JS. Something simple, silly, and educational (at least from a coding newbie standpoint). Still working on the CSS layout and overall aesthetics. Also need to fix issue where image won't load if you have to re-enter your selection.</p>
<h3>May 2, 2017</h3>
<p>The initial JS behavior is there. Still need to add: an alert when an incorrect answers is given, a new prompt to re-enter selection, and loading the correct image. Updated the styling and positioning in the CSS file.</p>
